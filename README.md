# AutoCapture-Selfie-Python
This project leverages Python and OpenCV to automatically capture selfies when a face is detected in the frame. The system uses real-time facial recognition through the webcam, identifying when a person is in focus and ready to take a picture. Once a clear face is detected, the program triggers the camera to capture the image without any manual intervention. Ideal for hands-free photo capturing, the project can be expanded with features like smile detection, pose analysis, or timed intervals for more sophisticated selfie automation.

#Key Features:

Face detection using OpenCV.
Automatic selfie capture.
Real-time webcam integration.
